# React + Vite

## Running the Application

To run the application, you need to start both the frontend and backend servers. Follow the steps below:

### Backend

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `BackEnd` directory:

   ```sh
   cd BackEnd
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```

### Frontend

1. Open another terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the frontend development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

### Accessing the Application

- The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if configured differently).
- The frontend development server will run on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if configured differently).

Make sure both servers are running simultaneously to ensure the application works correctly.
